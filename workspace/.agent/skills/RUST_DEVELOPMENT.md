# 🦀 Rust Development (fastapi_kkoma)

High-performance systems programming and backend development using Rust.

## Overview
This skill manages the Rust-based components of the OpenClaw ecosystem, specifically the `fastapi_kkoma` project. It provides capabilities for building, testing, and deploying high-performance Rust services and bridges.

## Key Capabilities
- **Build**: `cargo build` for compiling the Rust backend.
- **Run**: `cargo run` for local development and execution.
- **Test**: `cargo test` for verifying system integrity.
- **Optimize**: Leveraging Rust's memory safety and zero-cost abstractions for AGI performance.

## Locations
- Project Root: `D:\fastapi_kkoma\`
- Active Logic: `D:\fastapi_kkoma\src\main.rs`
